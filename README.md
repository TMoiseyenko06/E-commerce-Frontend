    A simple react project showing an incredably simple e-commerce page 

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Disclaimer](#disclamer)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/TMoiseyenko06/E-commerce-Frontend.git
```

## Usage

You can use the navbar at the top to navigate the application and to view all of the different options.

### Disclamer
    This project uses dummy api calls so some features are preset and/or do not work until an api is added (sometime in the future). also editing data will not result to any changes being made to the rest of the page due to the lack of a database to store information.
